### ⚠️ Only Missing: Real PayPal Credentials

## 🔧 How Your System Works Now

### Single Endpoint: `/api/paypal/capture-payment/`

**Create PayPal Order:**
```json
POST /api/paypal/capture-payment/
{
    "booking_id": 123,
    "customer_email": "user@example.com",
    "action": "create"
}
```

**Capture Payment:**
```json
POST /api/paypal/capture-payment/
{
    "booking_id": 123,
    "paypal_order_id": "order_id_from_create",
    "customer_email": "user@example.com",
    "action": "capture"
}
```

## 📋 Only 3 Credentials Needed in .env

```env
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_real_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_real_sandbox_secret
PAYPAL_API_BASE=https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com
```

## 🧪 System Testing

The system correctly detects your current placeholder credentials:

```
⚠️  WARNING: PayPal credentials appear to be placeholder/example credentials
    Please get real PayPal credentials from https://developer.paypal.com/
```
