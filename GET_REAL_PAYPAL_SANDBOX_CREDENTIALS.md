# Get Real PayPal Sandbox Credentials

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your current PayPal credentials in the `.env` file are **placeholder/example credentials**, not real PayPal credentials. That's why you're getting authentication errors.

## 🔧 How to Get Real PayPal Sandbox Credentials

### Step 1: Create PayPal Developer Account
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/
2. Sign in with your PayPal account (or create one)
3. Accept the developer agreement

### Step 2: Create a Sandbox Application
1. Click **"Create App"** button
2. Fill in the details:
   - **App Name**: "Access Auto Services Sandbox"
   - **Merchant**: Select your account
   - **Environment**: Select **"Sandbox"** (for testing)
   - **Features**: Check "Accept payments"

### Step 3: Get Your Real Credentials
After creating the app, you'll see:
- **Client ID**: A long string starting with "A" (like `AZaB1c2D3e4F5g6H7i8J9k0L...`)
- **Secret**: Click "Show" to reveal it (like `ELmN2o3P4q5R6s7T8u9V0w1X...`)

### Step 4: Update Your .env File
Replace the placeholder credentials in your `.env` file:

```env
# PayPal Sandbox Credentials - For Testing
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_real_sandbox_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_real_sandbox_secret_here
PAYPAL_API_BASE=https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com
```

## 🧪 Test Your Real Credentials

After updating your `.env` file, run:
```bash
python test_paypal_simplified.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ Successfully obtained PayPal access token
✅ Successfully created PayPal order
✅ All PayPal tests passed!
```

## 💳 Sandbox Testing

With real sandbox credentials, you can:
- Create test orders
- Use PayPal's test credit cards
- Test the complete payment flow
- No real money is involved

### PayPal Test Credit Cards (Sandbox Only):
- **Visa**: 4032035728926109
- **Mastercard**: 5425233430109903
- **American Express**: 374245455400001

## 🚀 When Ready for Production

When you're ready to accept real payments:

1. Create a **LIVE** app in PayPal Developer Console
2. Get your **LIVE** credentials
3. Update your `.env` file:
```env
# PayPal Live Credentials - For Production
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_real_live_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_real_live_secret_here
PAYPAL_API_BASE=https://api-m.paypal.com
```

## 🔍 Current Status

Your system is **ready** and **configured correctly**. You just need **real PayPal credentials** instead of the placeholder ones.

The integration will work perfectly once you have real credentials from PayPal Developer Console.
